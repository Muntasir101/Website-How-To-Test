Explanation:
Auto-Completion:

The Username and Email and Address fields now have auto-completion enabled using the <datalist> element.
Predefined options (like john_doe, jane_smith, etc.) are available for the user to select as they start typing in these fields.
Auto-Completion Example:

If the user begins typing j, options like john_doe and jane_smith will appear, and they can select one of them.
Form Submission:

The existing validation for fields like Username, Email, Password, and Phone Number remains the same, ensuring that any user input is validated correctly before form submission.
