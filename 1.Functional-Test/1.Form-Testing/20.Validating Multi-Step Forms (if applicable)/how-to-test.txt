Validating Multi-Step Forms involves ensuring that a multi-step form, which spans multiple pages or sections, functions correctly and provides a seamless user experience. Each step should be validated both individually and in the context of the overall form.

1. Test Scenarios
Scenario 1: Navigation Between Steps

Objective: Ensure that users can navigate between steps without data loss or errors.
Steps:
Complete the first step and navigate to the next.
Navigate back to the previous step and verify that data is retained.
Ensure that users can navigate forward and backward through all steps.
Scenario 2: Step-Specific Validation

Objective: Verify that each step has its own validation and that users cannot proceed to the next step with invalid data.
Steps:
Enter invalid data in one or more fields of the current step.
Attempt to move to the next step.
Check that appropriate validation messages are displayed and navigation is prevented until errors are corrected.
Scenario 3: Overall Form Validation

Objective: Ensure that the entire form is validated correctly upon final submission, considering data from all steps.
Steps:
Complete all steps with valid data.
Submit the form and verify that data from all steps is included in the final submission.
Attempt to submit the form with invalid data in any step and ensure that submission is blocked with appropriate error messages.
Scenario 4: Data Persistence Across Steps

Objective: Verify that data entered in previous steps is retained as users navigate through the form.
Steps:
Enter data in several steps.
Navigate to different steps and verify that previously entered data is preserved.
Scenario 5: Handling Incomplete Steps

Objective: Ensure that users are notified if they attempt to submit the form with incomplete or missing data in any step.
Steps:
Skip or leave fields blank in one or more steps.
Attempt to submit the form.
Verify that users receive notifications about incomplete steps and are guided to complete them.
Scenario 6: User Experience and Usability

Objective: Assess the overall usability of the multi-step form, including navigation, instructions, and user feedback.
Steps:
Review the form’s design and navigation flow.
Check that instructions and labels are clear at each step.
Evaluate the user experience and identify any potential usability issues.
2. How to Test
Manual Testing:

Prepare the Multi-Step Form:

Load the multi-step form in a web browser.
Test Navigation Between Steps:

Complete the current step and navigate to the next.
Go back to previous steps and verify data retention.
Test Step-Specific Validation:

Enter invalid data in a step and try to proceed.
Ensure validation errors are displayed and navigation is blocked.
Test Overall Form Validation:

Complete all steps and submit the form.
Verify that data from all steps is included and validate error handling.
Test Data Persistence:

Enter data in various steps and navigate between them.
Check that entered data is retained.
Test Incomplete Steps Handling:

Leave fields blank or incomplete and try to submit.
Verify that error messages guide users to complete the required steps.
Assess User Experience:

Review the form’s usability and design.
Ensure that navigation and instructions are intuitive.
Automated Testing:

WebDriver-Based Testing (e.g., Selenium):

Automate scenarios for completing, navigating, and validating multi-step forms.
Testing Frameworks (e.g., Cypress):

Write tests to simulate user interactions and validate step-by-step form functionality.
