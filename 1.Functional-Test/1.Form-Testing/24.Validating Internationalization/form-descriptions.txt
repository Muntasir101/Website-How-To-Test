Description
Country Patterns:

A JavaScript object countryPatterns maps country codes to their phone number validation patterns. Each pattern is a regular expression that matches the format of phone numbers for a specific country.
Examples provided:
US: +1 followed by 10 digits.
UK: +44 followed by 10 digits.
Japan: +81 followed by 10 digits.
Bangladesh: +880 followed by 10 digits.
Validation Logic:

The form collects the country code and phone number, then concatenates them to form a complete phone number.
The concatenated phone number is validated against the pattern specific to the selected country.
If the validation fails, an appropriate error message is displayed.
How It Works:

Form Submission: On form submission, the script checks if the country code and phone number match the pattern for the selected country.
Error Handling: Displays errors if the country code or phone number is invalid.
