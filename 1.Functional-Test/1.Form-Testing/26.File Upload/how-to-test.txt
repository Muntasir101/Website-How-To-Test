Test Scenarios for File Upload Functionality

1. Validate File Type

Scenario 1.1: Upload Unsupported File Type

Steps:

Select a file with an unsupported extension (e.g., .txt).
Complete other form fields with valid data.
Click the "Register" button.

Expected Result:

An error message should appear next to the file upload input: "Invalid file type. Only DOC, PDF, XLS, XLSX, CSV, JPG, and PNG files are allowed."
The form should not submit.

Scenario 1.2: Upload Supported File Type

Steps:

Select a file with a supported extension (e.g., .pdf).
Complete other form fields with valid data.
Click the "Register" button.

Expected Result:

The form should submit successfully if no other validation errors are present.

2. Validate File Size
Scenario 2.1: Upload File Larger than 10 MB

Steps:

Select a file larger than 10 MB (e.g., a large .jpg image).
Complete other form fields with valid data.
Click the "Register" button.

Expected Result:

An error message should appear next to the file upload input: "File size must not exceed 10 MB."
The form should not submit.

Scenario 2.2: Upload File Smaller than 10 MB

Steps:

Select a file smaller than 10 MB (e.g., a .jpg image under 5 MB).
Complete other form fields with valid data.
Click the "Register" button.

Expected Result:

The form should submit successfully if no other validation errors are present.

3. Validate Multiple Files (if applicable)
Scenario 3.1: Upload Multiple Files

Steps:

Select multiple files (if your implementation allows multiple uploads).
Ensure some files are of supported types and sizes, and others are not.
Complete other form fields with valid data.
Click the "Register" button.

Expected Result:

The form should validate each file. If any file is invalid (unsupported type or size), an error message should appear for that specific file.
The form should not submit if any file fails validation.

4. Validate File Removal
Scenario 4.1: Remove Uploaded File

Steps:

Upload a valid file.
Remove the file (if the form allows).
Complete other form fields with valid data.
Click the "Register" button.

Expected Result:

The form should handle the absence of a file gracefully, allowing submission if no file is required.

5. Validate No File Uploaded
Scenario 5.1: No File Uploaded

Steps:

Do not upload any file.
Complete other form fields with valid data.
Click the "Register" button.

Expected Result:

The form should submit successfully if the file upload is optional and no file is required.
