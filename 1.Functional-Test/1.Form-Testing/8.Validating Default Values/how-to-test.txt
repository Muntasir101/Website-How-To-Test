Validating Default Values in Fields
Example Scenario
Consider a form where certain fields are pre-populated with default values. These default values need to be validated to ensure they are appropriate and do not conflict with any validation rules or constraints applied to the fields.

Test Scenarios
Scenario 1: Verify default values are correctly populated in fields upon form load

Expected Result: Default values should appear in the relevant fields when the form is first loaded.
Scenario 2: Validate that default values meet field constraints

Expected Result: Default values should conform to any minimum, maximum, or format constraints applied to the field.
Scenario 3: Test field validation when default values are modified

Expected Result: If the user changes a default value, the modified value should be validated according to the fieldâ€™s rules.
Scenario 4: Ensure default values do not trigger validation errors

Expected Result: Default values should not trigger validation errors if they are within acceptable ranges or formats.
Scenario 5: Check that the form submission works correctly with default values

Expected Result: The form should submit successfully if default values are valid and meet all validation criteria.
Scenario 6: Verify that default values are correctly preserved during form interaction

Expected Result: Default values should be retained when the form is interacted with and should only be changed by user actions or programmatic updates.
Scenario 7: Validate default values for fields with dependencies or conditional visibility

Expected Result: Default values should be correctly applied to fields that are conditionally displayed or dependent on other fields.
Scenario 8: Test default values across different browsers and devices

Expected Result: Default values should be consistently displayed and validated across all supported browsers and devices.
Scenario 9: Ensure accessibility of default values

Expected Result: Default values should be properly announced by screen readers and accessible to users with assistive technologies.
Scenario 10: Test for scenarios where default values may conflict with user-entered values

Expected Result: Ensure that any conflicts between default values and user input are handled appropriately and do not cause errors or incorrect behavior.
How to Test
Manual Testing:

Interactive Testing:
Load the form and verify that default values are populated correctly.
Modify default values and check that they adhere to validation rules.
Boundary Testing:
Check if default values are within valid ranges and formats.
Automated Testing:

Using Selenium:
Write test scripts to automate the verification of default values, their validation, and form submission.
Using Cypress:
Create automated tests to ensure default values are correctly populated, validated, and retained.
Cross-Browser Testing:

Use tools like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to ensure default values are correctly displayed and validated across different browsers and devices.
Accessibility Testing:

Use tools like Axe or WAVE to verify that default values are accessible and properly announced by screen readers.
Tools to Use
Selenium WebDriver: Automate testing of default values, their validation, and form interactions.
Cypress: Provides an effective API for testing default values and their impact on form behavior.
BrowserStack or Sauce Labs: Ensure consistent display and validation of default values across different browsers and devices.
Axe Accessibility Tool: Validate that default values are accessible to users with assistive technologies.
