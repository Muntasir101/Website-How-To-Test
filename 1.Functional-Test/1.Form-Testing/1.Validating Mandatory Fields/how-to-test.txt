Example Scenario
You have a registration form on a website where certain fields like "First Name," "Email Address," and "Password" are mandatory. Users must fill out these fields to submit the form successfully.

Test Scenarios
Scenario 1: Submit the form with all mandatory fields left blank

Expected Result: The form should not be submitted, and validation messages should be displayed next to each mandatory field indicating that the field is required.
Scenario 2: Fill in some mandatory fields and leave others blank

Expected Result: The form should not be submitted, and validation messages should be displayed only for the mandatory fields that are left blank.
Scenario 3: Fill in all mandatory fields with valid data

Expected Result: The form should be submitted successfully without any validation errors.
Scenario 4: Attempt to submit the form with JavaScript disabled

Expected Result: The server-side validation should prevent form submission and return errors for missing mandatory fields.
Scenario 5: Test mandatory fields on different browsers and devices

Expected Result: Validation should work consistently across all browsers and devices.
Scenario 6: Attempt to bypass mandatory field validation by directly manipulating the form using browser developer tools

Expected Result: The form should still enforce validation, and the submission should be blocked if mandatory fields are empty.
Scenario 7: Validate that the correct error message is displayed when a mandatory field is not filled out

Expected Result: Each mandatory field should have a clear, user-friendly error message when left blank.
How to Test
Manual Testing:

Open the form in different browsers and devices.
Attempt to submit the form by leaving mandatory fields blank.
Observe the error messages and ensure the form does not submit.
Fill in the mandatory fields and ensure the form submits correctly.
Test with JavaScript disabled to ensure server-side validation is in place.
Attempt to manipulate form fields using browser developer tools and ensure validation is enforced.
Automated Testing:

Using Selenium:
Write test scripts that automate the submission of the form with and without mandatory fields filled in.
Verify that validation messages appear as expected.
Using Cypress:
Create tests that fill out the form partially and submit it.
Check that appropriate error messages are displayed for each empty mandatory field.
Using TestCafe:
Test mandatory fields across different browsers by writing cross-browser scripts to ensure consistency.
Tools to Use
Selenium WebDriver:

Great for automating web applications for testing purposes.
Supports multiple programming languages (Java, Python, C#, etc.).
Cypress:

A front-end testing tool built for modern web applications.
Offers easy setup and a robust API for writing tests.
TestCafe:

A tool for testing web applications that supports multiple browsers and devices.
Easy to set up and doesn't require WebDriver or browser plugins.
Browser Developer Tools:

Use for manual testing, especially for manipulating form fields and testing behavior with JavaScript disabled.
Accessibility Testing Tools:

Tools like Axe or WAVE can be used to ensure that error messages for mandatory fields are accessible to users with disabilities.
Cross-Browser Testing Tools:

BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to test form validation across various browsers and devices.
