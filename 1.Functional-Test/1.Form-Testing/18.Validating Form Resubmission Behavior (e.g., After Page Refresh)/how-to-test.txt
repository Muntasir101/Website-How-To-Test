Validating Form Resubmission Behavior involves ensuring that the form correctly handles and responds to user actions such as page refreshes, navigating away and returning, or retrying submission. This is important to avoid unintended data duplication or loss and to ensure a smooth user experience.

1. Test Scenarios
Scenario 1: Preventing Duplicate Submissions

Objective: Ensure that submitting the form twice does not create duplicate entries.
Steps:
Fill out and submit the form.
Refresh or navigate away and then return.
Verify that submitting the form again does not result in duplicate entries in the backend or form state.
Scenario 2: Handling Form Resubmission After Page Refresh

Objective: Verify that form data is correctly handled if the user refreshes the page after submitting the form.
Steps:
Fill out and submit the form.
Refresh the page.
Check if the form displays a success message or handles the resubmission gracefully (e.g., by displaying a confirmation or error message).
Scenario 3: Maintaining Form State After Navigation

Objective: Ensure that the form retains its state or correctly handles resubmission if the user navigates away and then returns to the form.
Steps:
Fill out the form and submit it.
Navigate away from the form page.
Return to the form page.
Verify if the form retains its state or handles resubmission appropriately.
Scenario 4: Handling Form Submission Errors

Objective: Ensure that form submission errors are handled correctly and do not cause unintended behavior upon resubmission.
Steps:
Simulate a submission error (e.g., server error).
Attempt to resubmit the form after the error.
Verify that the form displays appropriate error messages and does not create duplicate entries.
Scenario 5: Preventing Resubmission of Data During Page Reload

Objective: Verify that the form does not unintentionally resubmit data upon a page reload.
Steps:
Fill out and submit the form.
Refresh the page.
Check if the form data is resubmitted or if there is a mechanism to prevent this (e.g., a confirmation dialog).
2. How to Test
Manual Testing:

Prepare the Form:

Load the form in a web browser.
Test Duplicate Submissions:

Submit the form with sample data.
Refresh or navigate away and return.
Resubmit the form and verify if there are any duplicates or unintended behavior.
Test Resubmission After Page Refresh:

Submit the form and refresh the page.
Check if the form displays a confirmation or handles the resubmission gracefully.
Test Form State After Navigation:

Submit the form and navigate away.
Return to the form page and check if the state is preserved or handled correctly.
Test Submission Errors:

Simulate errors during form submission and check how resubmissions are handled.
Ensure that error messages are displayed and no duplicates are created.
Test Preventing Data Resubmission:

Submit the form and refresh the page.
Verify if there are mechanisms to prevent data from being resubmitted or if user confirmation is required.
Automated Testing:

WebDriver-Based Testing (e.g., Selenium):

Automate scenarios for submitting, refreshing, navigating, and resubmitting forms to verify correct handling of form resubmission behavior.
Testing Frameworks (e.g., Cypress):

Write tests to simulate user actions such as submitting, refreshing, and navigating to ensure proper form handling and behavior.
