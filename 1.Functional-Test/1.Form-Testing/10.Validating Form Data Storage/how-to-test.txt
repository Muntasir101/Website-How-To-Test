Validating Form Data Storage
Validating form data storage involves ensuring that the data entered into a form is correctly saved and retrieved from the storage mechanism used. Here’s how to approach validating form data storage:

1. Test Scenarios
Scenario 1: Verify Data Storage

Objective: Ensure that data entered into the form is stored correctly in the storage mechanism (e.g., localStorage, sessionStorage, database).
Steps:
Enter data into the form fields.
Submit or save the form.
Inspect the storage mechanism (e.g., using browser developer tools) to confirm that the data has been saved.
Scenario 2: Validate Data Retrieval

Objective: Ensure that stored data is retrieved correctly and populated into the form fields when the form page is loaded.
Steps:
Manually store data in the storage mechanism or submit the form to save data.
Reload or revisit the form page.
Check that the stored data is displayed in the form fields.
Scenario 3: Check Data Consistency

Objective: Ensure that the data remains consistent between the storage and the form.
Steps:
Store data in the form and then modify the data directly in storage (e.g., using browser developer tools).
Reload or revisit the form page.
Verify that the form reflects the modified data from storage.
Scenario 4: Validate Data Security

Objective: Ensure that sensitive data is stored securely and is not exposed or accessible inappropriately.
Steps:
Enter sensitive data (e.g., passwords) into the form.
Inspect the storage mechanism to ensure that sensitive data is encrypted or obfuscated.
Check that sensitive data is not exposed in client-side storage or developer tools.
Scenario 5: Test Data Removal

Objective: Ensure that data can be correctly removed from storage when required (e.g., upon form reset or user logout).
Steps:
Enter and store data in the form.
Trigger data removal (e.g., click a reset button or log out).
Verify that the data has been removed from the storage.
2. How to Test
Manual Testing:

Fill Out the Form:

Enter data into all fields of the form.
Submit or Save:

Complete the form submission or save action to store the data.
Verify Storage:

Open the browser’s developer tools and inspect the storage mechanism (e.g., localStorage, sessionStorage).
Confirm that the data is correctly saved in the storage.
Reload or Revisit:

Refresh the form page or revisit it.
Check that the data is retrieved from storage and correctly displayed in the form fields.
Manual Data Modification:

Modify the data directly in the storage mechanism (e.g., using developer tools).
Reload the form page and verify that the updated data is displayed in the form fields.
Check Security:

Inspect the storage for sensitive data.
Verify that sensitive data is encrypted or obfuscated as needed.
Remove Data:

Trigger data removal (e.g., using a reset button).
Confirm that the data is no longer present in the storage.
