How It Works
Load Saved Data on Page Load:

When the page loads, the DOMContentLoaded event listener retrieves saved data from localStorage and populates the form fields with it.
Auto-Save Data on Input Change:

The input event listener on the form saves the current values of the form fields to localStorage every time a user changes the input.
Clear Saved Data on Form Submission:

Upon successful form submission, the formData is removed from localStorage to clear the saved data.
