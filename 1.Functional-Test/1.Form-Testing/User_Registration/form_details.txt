Form Validation:

JavaScript validation is added for mandatory fields (Username, Email, and Password).
The form will not submit until all mandatory fields are validated.

Reset Button:

Added a "Reset" button that allows users to clear all the form data.
The button has a class of .reset-btn for separate styling.
Button Styles:

Styled both the "Register" and "Reset" buttons for a consistent appearance.
The "Reset" button has a different background color to differentiate it from the "Register" button.
Button Alignment:

The buttons are placed side by side using flexbox with equal width (48%) for a balanced layout.
