Example Scenario
Consider a user registration form where the "Password" field is masked for privacy reasons. Input masking hides the characters being typed, typically by displaying dots or asterisks (*). The password field must still undergo validation to ensure it meets the required security criteria (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of special characters, etc.).

Test Scenarios
Scenario 1: Enter a password that meets all security criteria

Expected Result: The form should accept the input without any validation errors, and the password should remain masked.
Scenario 2: Enter a password that is too short (e.g., less than the required minimum length)

Expected Result: The form should display an error message indicating that the password is too short and prevent submission.
Scenario 3: Enter a password without any special characters (if required)

Expected Result: The form should display an error message indicating the need for special characters and prevent submission.
Scenario 4: Confirm that the input is masked while typing

Expected Result: The password should be masked with dots or asterisks as the user types.
Scenario 5: Test the visibility toggle feature (if applicable)

Expected Result: If the form includes a "Show Password" option, clicking it should reveal the password. Clicking it again should re-mask the password.
Scenario 6: Verify password auto-completion (if applicable)

Expected Result: If the browser auto-fills the password field, the password should remain masked, and the form should validate the auto-filled password as it would with manually entered data.
Scenario 7: Test on different browsers and devices to ensure consistent input masking

Expected Result: Input masking should function correctly across all supported browsers and devices.
Scenario 8: Enter and confirm password fields (if applicable)

Expected Result: The form should validate that both the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields match exactly, and both should remain masked during input.
Scenario 9: Check how input masking behaves with accessibility tools

Expected Result: Screen readers should announce the presence of a password field but not the specific characters being typed.
Scenario 10: Test for possible security vulnerabilities related to input masking

Expected Result: Ensure that the password is not exposed in the browser's developer tools or in any unexpected ways.
How to Test
Manual Testing:

Enter passwords that meet or fail the validation criteria and observe the form’s behavior.
Toggle the visibility of the password (if the feature is available) and ensure masking works as expected.
Test on various devices and browsers to confirm consistent input masking.
Automated Testing:

Using Selenium:
Write test scripts to automate the entry of various passwords and verify that input masking and validation work as expected.
Using Cypress:
Create tests to verify that masked passwords behave correctly and that error messages are shown when validation fails.
Cross-Browser Testing:

Use tools like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to ensure consistent input masking across different browsers and devices.
Accessibility Testing:

Utilize tools like Axe to ensure that masked input fields are properly identified by screen readers and that no sensitive information is exposed.
Security Testing:

Perform penetration testing or use security-focused tools to ensure that the masked password isn’t exposed through developer tools or other browser features.
Tools to Use
Selenium WebDriver: Automate the testing of input masking and validation across different browsers.
Cypress: Provides a robust API for testing masked fields and password validation.
BrowserStack or Sauce Labs: Perform cross-browser and device testing to ensure consistent behavior.
Axe Accessibility Tool: Validate that input masking fields are correctly identified and handled by assistive technologies.
Burp Suite: Test for security vulnerabilities related to input masking.
