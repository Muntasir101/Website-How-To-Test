Validating Form Submission with Invalid Data
1. Test Scenarios
Scenario 1: Missing Mandatory Fields

Objective: Ensure that the form does not submit if mandatory fields are left empty.
Steps:
Leave one or more mandatory fields empty.
Attempt to submit the form.
Verify that the form does not submit and that appropriate error messages are displayed.
Scenario 2: Invalid Field Formats

Objective: Ensure that fields with specific format requirements (e.g., email, phone number) are validated correctly.
Steps:
Enter incorrect formats in fields that require specific formats (e.g., a malformed email address).
Attempt to submit the form.
Verify that the form does not submit and that validation errors are shown for the incorrectly formatted fields.
Scenario 3: Out-of-Range Values

Objective: Ensure that numeric or date fields accept only values within a specified range.
Steps:
Enter values outside the allowable range for numeric or date fields.
Attempt to submit the form.
Verify that the form does not submit and that appropriate error messages are displayed for out-of-range values.
Scenario 4: Invalid Input Lengths

Objective: Ensure that fields with length constraints (e.g., minimum and maximum length) are validated properly.
Steps:
Enter data that exceeds or does not meet the length constraints in fields.
Attempt to submit the form.
Verify that the form does not submit and that error messages are shown for invalid lengths.
Scenario 5: Error Messages Display

Objective: Ensure that error messages are clear, informative, and correctly positioned near the relevant fields.
Steps:
Trigger validation errors by entering invalid data.
Verify that error messages are displayed next to or below the relevant fields and provide clear instructions on what needs to be corrected.
2. How to Test
Manual Testing:

Prepare the Form:

Load the form in a web browser.
Input Invalid Data:

For mandatory fields, leave them empty.
For format-specific fields, enter data that does not match the required format.
For range-restricted fields, enter values outside the permissible range.
For length-constrained fields, enter data that is too short or too long.
Attempt Submission:

Click the submit button.
Verify Form Behavior:

Check that the form does not submit and remains on the same page.
Ensure that appropriate error messages are displayed for each invalid input.
Confirm that error messages are clear and informative.
Check Error Message Placement:

Ensure that error messages are positioned correctly near the relevant fields.
Automated Testing:

WebDriver-Based Testing (e.g., Selenium):
Use WebDriver to automate the process of entering invalid data, attempting form submission, and verifying error messages.
Testing Frameworks (e.g., Cypress):
Automate form validation scenarios to check for correct behavior and error message displays.
