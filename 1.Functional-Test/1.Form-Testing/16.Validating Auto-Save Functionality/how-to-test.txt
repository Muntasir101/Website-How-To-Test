Validating Auto-Save Functionality involves ensuring that a form automatically saves user data periodically or during user interactions to prevent data loss. This is particularly useful for long forms or applications where users might be interrupted.

1. Test Scenarios
Scenario 1: Periodic Auto-Save

Objective: Verify that the form data is automatically saved at regular intervals.
Steps:
Fill out the form with data.
Wait for the auto-save interval to pass.
Check if the data has been saved by refreshing the page or navigating away and returning to the form.
Scenario 2: Auto-Save on Input Change

Objective: Ensure that the form data is saved whenever the user makes changes to the input fields.
Steps:
Start filling out the form.
Change data in any of the fields.
Navigate away from the form or refresh the page.
Check if the last entered data is preserved.
Scenario 3: Auto-Save on Form Submission

Objective: Verify that the form data is saved when the user submits the form, even if the submission process encounters errors.
Steps:
Fill out the form and submit it.
Simulate a submission error (e.g., server error).
Verify if the form data was saved and is preserved upon retrying submission.
Scenario 4: Auto-Save During Session Timeout

Objective: Ensure that data is saved automatically if the session is about to time out or is interrupted.
Steps:
Start filling out the form.
Simulate a session timeout or interruption.
Verify if the form data is saved and restored upon re-login or session recovery.
Scenario 5: Auto-Save Confirmation

Objective: Ensure that users receive confirmation or indication that their data has been saved automatically.
Steps:
Make changes to the form.
Verify if there is any indication (e.g., a message or icon) that the data has been auto-saved.
2. How to Test
Manual Testing:

Prepare the Form:

Load the form in a web browser.
Test Periodic Auto-Save:

Fill out the form with data.
Wait for the auto-save interval.
Refresh the page or navigate away.
Check if the data is retained.
Test Auto-Save on Input Change:

Make changes to form fields.
Navigate away or refresh the page.
Check if the changes are saved.
Test Auto-Save on Form Submission:

Complete the form and submit.
Simulate an error during submission.
Check if the form data is preserved.
Test During Session Timeout:

Fill out the form and simulate a timeout.
Check if the data is saved and can be recovered.
Check Auto-Save Confirmation:

Make changes to the form.
Verify if thereâ€™s any confirmation that the data has been auto-saved.
Automated Testing:

WebDriver-Based Testing (e.g., Selenium):

Automate scenarios for periodic auto-save, input changes, and error handling to check if the data is correctly saved and restored.
Testing Frameworks (e.g., Cypress):

Write tests to simulate user interactions and check if auto-save functionality works as intended.
