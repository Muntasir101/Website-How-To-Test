Testing the auto-save feature involves several steps to ensure that data is saved, retrieved, and cleared correctly. Here are some test scenarios you can use:

1. Initial Page Load
Scenario:

Open the form page for the first time.
Expected Result:

No data should be pre-filled in the form fields since localStorage should be empty initially.
2. Form Input Auto-Save
Scenario:

Enter data into each form field (Username, Email, Password, Phone Number, Address).
Check localStorage using browser developer tools to confirm that the data is saved.
Steps:

Fill in each form field.
Open browser developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
Go to the Application tab (or Storage in some browsers).
Look for localStorage and check the formData key.
Expected Result:

The formData key should be present in localStorage.
The values should match what was entered in the form fields.
3. Page Reload
Scenario:

Reload the page after entering data into the form.
Steps:

Enter data into the form fields.
Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R).
Expected Result:

The form fields should be pre-filled with the saved data from localStorage.
4. Form Reset
Scenario:

Use the Reset button on the form.
Steps:

Enter data into the form fields.
Click the Reset button.
Expected Result:

The form fields should be cleared.
The localStorage should be emptied (the formData key should be removed).
5. Form Submission
Scenario:

Submit the form with valid data.
Steps:

Enter valid data into all form fields.
Click the Register button.
Expected Result:

An alert should appear indicating successful submission.
The form should be submitted (if the form's action URL is set up to handle submissions).
6. Form Validation
Scenario:

Enter invalid data into required fields and submit the form.
Steps:

Leave one or more required fields empty or enter invalid data.
Click the Register button.
Expected Result:

Error messages should be displayed for invalid fields.
The form should not be submitted.
7. Auto-Save After Editing
Scenario:

Edit existing data in the form.
Steps:

Open the page with pre-filled data from localStorage.
Modify some of the data in the form fields.
Check localStorage to confirm that the changes are saved.
Expected Result:

localStorage should be updated with the new values.
Tools for Testing
Browser Developer Tools: Use the Application or Storage tab to inspect localStorage.
Console: Use console.log(localStorage.getItem('formData')) to manually check saved data.
