Explanation
Loading Data:

When the page loads (window.onload), the script retrieves saved data from localStorage and populates the form fields with this data.
Auto-Save:

An event listener for input events on the form updates localStorage with the current values of the form fields. This ensures that changes are saved in real-time as the user types.
Reset Handling:

An event listener for the reset event clears the saved data from localStorage when the form is reset.
Validation and Submission:

The existing validation and submission logic remains unchanged.
This implementation provides a basic auto-save feature that helps users retain their input across page reloads and resets.
