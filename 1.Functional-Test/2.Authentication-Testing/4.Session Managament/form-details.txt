I'll show you how to implement a basic session timeout mechanism using JavaScript on the client side.

Key Points:
Session Management: Set a timeout that logs out the user after a period of inactivity.
Session Storage: Use sessionStorage to keep track of the user's session activity.

Explanation:
Session Timeout Configuration: sessionTimeout is set to 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds).
Session Timer: startSessionTimer sets a session start time in sessionStorage and starts an interval to check for session timeout.
Check Session Timeout: checkSessionTimeout checks if the session has expired and redirects to the login page if so.
User Interaction: mousemove and keydown events are used to reset the session timer, keeping the session active as long as the user is interacting with the page.
