Test Scenarios for Session Management
1. Successful Login and Session Timeout
Test Scenario: Log in with valid credentials and wait for the session timeout period to elapse.
Steps:
Open the login page (/index.html).
Enter valid credentials (e.g., username: admin, password: adminpass).
Click the "Login" button.
Wait for 2 minutes (120 seconds) without any user interaction.
Expected Result:
After 2 minutes of inactivity, an alert should appear saying "Session timed out. Please log in again."
The page should automatically redirect to the login page (/index.html).
2. Reset Session Timer on User Activity
Test Scenario: Verify that user activity (mouse movement or keyboard input) resets the session timer.
Steps:
Log in with valid credentials.
After accessing the dashboard, wait for 1 minute.
Move the mouse or type on the keyboard.
Wait for an additional 1 minute.
Expected Result:
The session timer should reset after detecting user activity.
The user should not be logged out and should remain on the dashboard.
3. Session Timeout During Page Navigation
Test Scenario: Verify that navigating away and returning to the page resets the session timer.
Steps:
Log in with valid credentials.
Access the Admin Dashboard.
Wait for 1 minute.
Navigate to another page (e.g., logout or another section).
Return to the Admin Dashboard after 1 minute.
Expected Result:
The session timer should be reset upon returning to the Admin Dashboard.
If the session was not timed out during navigation, the user should still be logged in and able to access the dashboard.
4. Multiple Tabs/Windows Session Timeout
Test Scenario: Test if the session timeout behavior is consistent across multiple tabs or windows.
Steps:
Log in with valid credentials in one tab/window.
Open another tab/window and navigate to the Admin Dashboard.
Leave both tabs/windows inactive for 2 minutes.
Expected Result:
Both tabs/windows should log out the user after 2 minutes of inactivity.
Both tabs/windows should redirect to the login page after the session times out.
5. Session Handling After Manual Interaction
Test Scenario: Verify that manual interaction with the session storage API does not affect session timeout functionality.
Steps:
Log in with valid credentials.
Access the Admin Dashboard.
Use browser developer tools to manually modify session storage.
Leave the page inactive for 2 minutes.
Expected Result:
The session should still time out after 2 minutes of inactivity, regardless of manual modifications to session storage.
The user should be redirected to the login page.
6. Edge Case: Network Interruption During Session
Test Scenario: Simulate a network interruption to test session timeout behavior.
Steps:
Log in with valid credentials.
Access the Admin Dashboard.
Simulate a network interruption (e.g., disconnect from the internet).
Wait for 2 minutes with the network disconnected.
Reconnect the network and attempt to access the dashboard.
Expected Result:
If the session times out during the network interruption, the user should be redirected to the login page once the network is reconnected.
7. Concurrent Session Management
Test Scenario: Verify that concurrent sessions (e.g., logging in from multiple devices) handle session timeout independently.
Steps:
Log in with valid credentials on two different devices or browsers.
Leave both sessions inactive for 2 minutes.
Expected Result:
Both sessions should time out independently and redirect to the login page after 2 minutes of inactivity.
