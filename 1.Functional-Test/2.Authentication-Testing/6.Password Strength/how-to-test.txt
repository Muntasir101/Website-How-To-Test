Password Confirmation Test (Mismatch)

Objective: Ensure the system notifies users if passwords do not match.
Steps:
Enter a valid username (e.g., validuser).
Enter a valid password (e.g., Valid1!).
Enter a different password in the confirmation field (e.g., Valid2!).
Click "Sign Up".
Expected Result: Error message indicating the passwords do not match.
2. Real-Time Feedback Tests
Password Strength Indicator

Objective: Validate that the password strength indicator updates correctly.
Steps:
Enter a weak password (e.g., password).
Observe the strength indicator.
Enter a moderate password (e.g., Password1).
Observe the strength indicator.
Enter a strong password (e.g., Valid1!Strong).
Observe the strength indicator.
Expected Result: Strength indicator should reflect "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong" based on password criteria.

3. Usability Tests
Empty Fields Submission

Objective: Ensure that submitting the form with empty fields displays appropriate error messages.
Steps:
Leave all fields empty.

Field Focus and Blur

Objective: Check if real-time validation occurs when focusing out of fields.
Steps:
Enter invalid data in the password field.
Focus out of the password field.
Check if real-time validation messages are displayed.
Expected Result: Validation messages should display correctly when focus is lost from the field.
