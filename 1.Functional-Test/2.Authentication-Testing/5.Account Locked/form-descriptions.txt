How It Works
Login Page:

The login form checks the user's credentials against predefined values.
If the credentials are incorrect, the failed attempts counter increments.
After 5 failed attempts, the account is locked for 5 minutes.
If the credentials are correct, the user is redirected based on their role, and the session timer starts.
User Dashboard (Session Timeout):

The session timeout is set to 2 minutes.
If the user is inactive for 2 minutes, they are redirected to the login page.
Notes:
You can adjust the maximum failed attempts, lockout time, and session timeout according to your requirements.
The implementation uses localStorage to track failed attempts and lockout status, and sessionStorage to track the session timeout.
The example assumes that you're only managing three roles: Admin, Manager, and User. You can expand or modify this logic as needed.

Account Lockout Time Check:

Added code to check if the lockout period has expired when the page loads.
If the lockout period has not expired, display the remaining time and disable the login button.
Reset Mechanism:

If the lockout period has expired, reset the failed attempts and allow login.
Error Messages and Attempt Display:

Updated error messages and remaining attempts display based on the current state of localStorage.
