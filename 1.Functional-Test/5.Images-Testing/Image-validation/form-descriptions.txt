1. Overlays
Overlays are semi-transparent layers that appear over images when you hover. They can contain additional information or actions, like "Add to Cart" buttons or product details.

2. Hover Effects
Hover effects can include scaling the image, changing the background color, or revealing additional information when the user hovers over a product card.

3. Image Masks
Image masks can be used to create shapes or effects on the images, such as circular images or images with unique borders.

Overlay: The .overlay class is added to a div within each .product-card. This div appears over the image with a semi-transparent background when the user hovers over the card.
Hover Effects: The .product-card scale and shadow effect enhances interactivity. The :hover effect on the .product-card also affects the .overlay, making it visible when hovering.
Image Masks: You can use border-radius on the images to achieve circular or rounded corners.
